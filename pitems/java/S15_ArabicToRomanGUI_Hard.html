<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>
This program handles the conversion of Arabic numbers to the equivalent Roman numeral and back.

<p>
The code consists of the ArabicToRoman class that extends JFrame.  Two JTextField objects are created for the input, and the inner class KeyHandler listens for keyboard events.
</p>
<p>
As the user enters a number in either field, the key release is heard by the KeyHandler object and a method is called to update the other text field to the equivalent amount entered.
</p>
<p>
Roman numeral strings are read from left to right to convert to Arabic.  After conversion, the Arabic number is converted right back as a way to ensure correct formatting of the Roman numeral string.
</p>
<p>
Arabic numbers are assessed by the largest equivalent of Roman numeral/s, which is then subtracted from the amount and the numeral is appended to the Roman numeral string.  This is repeated until 0 and the result is written to the JTextField.
