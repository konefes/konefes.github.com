<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>
This program creates a class that represents a set of integers that can include any numbers from 0 to 100.  The class must provide ways to represent both the union and intersection of two of these sets of integers.
</p>

<h3>User Documentation</h3>
<p>
The program automatically creates two instances of the IntegerSet class and uses them to test the union and intersection static methods.  Each IntegerSet can consist of any combination of the integers from 0 to 100, with no duplicate integers.  First, the IntegerSets are created.  Then 6 integers are inserted into each, and printed out.  The union and intersection of these two IntegerSets are then printed.  Following that, two integers are removed from each set and they are printed again.  Finally, the union and intersection methods are called again and the results printed.

<p>
The IntegerSet class consists of a boolean array that holds a value of true for each integer corresponding to the index.
</p>
<p>
The IntegerSet class also contains two static methods: 
</p>
<p>
1) The union method takes two IntegerSet objects and returns a new IntegerSet consisting of integers that exist in either of the two parameter IntegerSets.

<p>
2) The union method takes two IntegerSet objects and returns a new IntegerSet consisting of integers that exist in both of the two parameter IntegerSets.
