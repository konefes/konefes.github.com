<h3>Problem Description</h3>
<p>
This program creates a windowed program using Java Swing components that displays a circle and a slider that can change the circle's diameter between 100 and 200.  The circle is updated in real-time, as are the displayed values for diameter, area, and circumference.
</p>
<hr>

<h3>User Documentation</h3>
<p>
As the user moves the slider back and forth, the circle is redrawn and the values of the diameter, area, and circumference are updated.
</p>
<p>
Calculations: Area = pi *(diameter)^2 / 4; Circumference = pi * diameter
</p>

<p>
The code consists of the CircleWithSlider class that extends JFrame.  An object of type CirclePanel is created, along with a JSlider to control the circle drawn by the CirclePanel.  An anonymous inner class is created in the CircleWithSlider constructor to handle state change events generated by the slider, which calls the CirclePanel objects setDiameter method.
</p>
<p>
The calculations for area and circumference are performed using PI from java.lang.Math.PI.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, a JTextArea displays the diameter and the results of the calculations for area and circumference.  It is also updated by the handler created in the anonymous inner class of the CircleWithSlider constructor.
