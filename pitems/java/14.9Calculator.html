<p>
The code consists of the Calculator class that extends JFrame.  It creates a JTextField for the display, and nests a grid of JButtons to get the input.  A series of boolean values are used to store the state of the current calculation and are used to determine the behavior of each button press.  For example, an operator button pressed when the program first starts does nothing, but if pressed after a number has been entered it updates the display and the calculator is prepared for another input.
</p>
<p>
An inner class ButtonHandler implements ActionListener to handle the events generated by pressing buttons.
